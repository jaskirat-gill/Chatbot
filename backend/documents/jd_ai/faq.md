## Solution-Specific Questions

### How accurate are the chatbots?
Our chatbots typically handle 70-85% of inquiries without human intervention. Accuracy improves over time as the AI learns from interactions. Complex or sensitive issues are seamlessly handed off to human agents.

### Can the chatbot handle multiple languages?
Yes! Our chatbots support 95+ languages. We can configure which languages to support based on your customer base.

### How accurate are predictive analytics forecasts?
Forecast accuracy typically ranges from 85-95% depending on data quality and business volatility. We continuously refine models to improve accuracy over time.

### Will AI-generated content sound robotic?
Not at all! We train our content generation models on your brand voice and style. The content is natural, engaging, and indistinguishable from human-written content. You always have final approval before publishing.

### Can the AI make decisions autonomously?
Our solutions can be configured for different levels of automation:
- Fully automated (AI makes and executes decisions)

Most clients start semi-automated and increase automation as they build confidence.
